    <h3>Backstory</h3>
    <div class="backstory">
    <p>Life was so simple back then... baling hay, carrying bags of feed to the cattle, making eyes at the local girls in the village when his family took their wares to the market.  The life of a 15-year old farm boy...</p>
    <p>I hated fixing that damn fence, he remembered, his countenance a mix of grin and grimace. Why do I think of these things now? So far away and such a long time ago...</p>
    <p>It was dusk, a cloudy day as I recall.  The day before I snuck out of the house to meet Cassi Windermere... I wonder what happened to her... no.  That life is gone, and it's never coming back. </p>    
    <p>I remember the hood, though.  The sudden darkness, that strange language, the pain and then the nothing.  When the mask came off by torchlight I saw my first drow, strange beasts and man-like creatures I thought were only tales to scare children at night.  We were to fight for their entertainment, and fight we did.</p>
    <p>I hated the pain.  I was blessed to live a life of manual labor, for it gave me a foundation of strength.  The pain taught me, forced me to adapt.  To alter my tactics.  To withstand and even laugh at my wounds.  To fear nothing, not even death, for with a moment's hesitation, it could be over.  I began to relish the fight, to bear witness to the utter destruction of those who would challenge me.  I despised my servitude, though.</p>
    <p>That's how I came to be known as "The Butcher".  Biggest damn orc I'd ever seen, carrying the biggest damn sword I'd ever seen came into town with a few of his friends.  Kept talking about how they raided villages and slaughtered people topside.  Don't even know why it bothered me, I hadn't thought about my family or topsiders in years, but it did.  So of course we had to rumble...</p>
    <p>I remember his look of rage when he tried to knock me over and I stopped him dead in his tracks.  Must have been pretty embarrassing for him in front of his tribe, to be bested in strength by a human.  The gathering crowd certainly laughed.  A quick kick hyperextending his knee brought him to the ground, followed by my fist.  What a rush to see that glimmer of fear cross his face.  I was on a roll.  Before I knew it, I had that sword in my hand.  It was surprisingly well made, he must have taken that off of someone up top... sure took his arm off like a hot knife through butter.  "There is no mercy in the pits, there will be none here," I said as I raised the sword to deal the killing blow.</p>
    <p>Then he cursed my family.</p>
    <p>I'm glad I keep my cool now, because I lost it that day.  The pain, the loss, the servitude, the rage, all of that came out over the next thirty seconds.  When I snapped back to reality, staring at the pieces of orc littering the ground in front me, with the crowd chanting "BUTCHER, BUTCHER," I knew I would fight for no one but myself for now on.  I'm pretty sure when I returned to my keeper, covered in orc blood, with anger burning in my eyes telling him he and his minions would be next unless he released me he wouldn't be happy, and he wasn't, but his self-preservation instinct won out that day.</p>
    <p>And now here I sit in this tavern, drinking my ale in this forsaken city in which only the gods know how far is underground.  Wondering if I'll ever have a Cassi Windermere of my own or if I'm destined to fight down here forever.  Or maybe my destiny lies down a different road.</p>
